"For your final project, we are going to make a simple video game console site.
There is an API collection of consoles available @ the following endpoint (no trailing slash): http://csc225.mockable.io/consoles
The individual resources (consoles) are available at the following endpoint scheme: http://csc225.mockable.io/consoles/{ID} where {ID} is the ID from the API collection endpoint, a single example is http://csc225.mockable.io/consoles/1   (DO NOT INCLUDE A TRAILING SLASH that will return a 404)
The collection has limited data, just the ID, Name, and Image. The individual resource endpoints have more data, including the release year, country and price."
